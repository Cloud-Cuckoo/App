They imagine. They heal.\nThey explore. They create. They inspire.\nThey push the human race forward.\n\nMaybe they have to be crazy.\nHow else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?\nOr sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written?\nOr gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?\nWe make tools for these kinds of people.\n\nWhile some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.\nBecause the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.";
